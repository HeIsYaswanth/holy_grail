          One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This
          means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in
          dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one.
          <P>Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This
          is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and
          event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people
          become very sad because of failures. </P> <P>However, these people certainly
          fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason
          for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable
          lesson. This means every failure builds experience.</P> <P> This experience is
          what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge
          number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people
          believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. </P> <p>However, it is pain
          that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of
          increasing mental resilience. </p> <p>Above all, pain enriches the mind. The
          uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the
          hour of ones death. This probably is the most important reason to
          live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic
          is an utter wastage of Life.</p> One must certainly enjoy the beautiful
          blessings of Life before death overtakes.
